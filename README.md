# 42_Exam_rank_02
### Description&Summary

This is the first exam in the cursus of 42. We need to do 4 code challenges picked at random from a collection of ~ 60 challenges. We need to do 1 challenge per level in order of difficulty starting from level 0 (Easy) to level 3 (Hard). If you can't beat the challenge of a certain level you can't go to the next and have to do the exam again until you can beat all 4 exercices/levels that will be randomized again.
