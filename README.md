### Description&Summary

This is the first exam in the cursus of 42. We need to do 4 code challenges picked from a collection of ~ 60 challenges, 1 challenge per level ranked from level 0 (Easy) to level 3 (Hard). You need to do them in order to pass the exam (0,1,2,3). If you can't beat the challenge of a certain level you can't go to the next and have to do the exam again until you can beat all 4 exercices at random.
